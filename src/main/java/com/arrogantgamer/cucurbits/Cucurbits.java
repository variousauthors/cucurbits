/*
 * NEXTSTEPS
 * =========
 * 
 * v0.1.0 
 * 
 * [] Lava Melon
 *    - [o] seeds, stem, attached stem, fruit
 *    - [o] it searches below for lava and only grows fruit if it can find lava
 *      - [o] how does it search? randomly. :. it gets slower and slower the less laval is below it
 *      - [o] where does it search? for now I am stuck on this 3x3x5 area inspired by grass... but let's see
 *        this encourages planting a patch of them to harvest the magma from a pool, but a
 *        more dynamic shape, like a + or a â™¢ encourages more dynamic planting patterns...
 *        (actually yes, lets take inspiration from Melon with its strange growth patterns
 *        this makes for more interesting gameplay)
 *      - someone on discord suggested "detect lava lakes deep underground" and I like this a lot,
 *        but maybe that should be the "ancient lavamelon" like... like the evolved form? Or the
 *        deep melon, which grows only deep underground...
 *    - it generates around lava lakes? (but in that case, it should be able to search an area
 *      that lets it pull laval from a lava pool even if it is on the edge of the pool...
 *      - in addition, what is it plantable in? Can it grow in sand??? Gravel???
 *        - PROBLEM <- sand and gravel get to decide what can be planted in them :D
 *        - SOLUTION <- I can override the methods in stem that care about canSustainPlant 
 *    - [o] the fruit
 *      - [o] it can be crafted with a bucket to make a lava bucket
 *      - [] it can be used instead of a lava bucket in recipes
 *        - like... many of the recipes that use lava_bucket return empty bucket
 *          so we'd have to figure that out
 *      - [] it can be used like a lava bucket in machines
 *        - seeeeems like it should extend BucketItem and overwrite some methods
 *      - [] it stacks and has the same burntime as lava
 *        - how? item implements getBurnTime
 *        
 *      - [x] it has Material.LAVA so maybe the game will treat it weirdly???
 *        - my goal here is to have thermalily treat the fruit as lava
 *        - this won't work...
 *    - click with sheers, it releases the lava on that side (and carves the melon)
 *      - click the top, it becomes like a lava cauldron: nooby says have a "whole" and "sliced"
 *        state, and "lava" and "not lava" states
 *      - I think I would just do a whole "lavamelon cauldron" block though
 *    - put it in a fluid extracting machine, and it will extract the lava
 *    - wearing a carved one on your head provides some degree of fire protection
